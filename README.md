# Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

# Description 

For this project, my goal was to create a portfolio showcasing my current work. In the future, I plan to add more projects that highlight a range of skills. As I develop new applications, I will include them in this portfolio along with my thought process for each one. I had a portfolio before this one, but I used a service instead of building it myself. By coding this portfolio with the CSS skills I've learned, I can see how much progress I've made as a student in a short period of time. During the project, I lost all of my code halfway through due to my own error. This experience taught me the importance of pushing my code to GitHub as frequently as possible.
