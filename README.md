# Professional-Portfolio
Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

For this project, my goal was to create a portfolio showcasing my current work. In the future, I plan to add more projects that highlight a range of skills. As I develop new applications, I will include them in this portfolio along with my thought process for each one. I had a portfolio before this one, but I used a service instead of building it myself. By coding this portfolio with the CSS skills I've learned, I can see how much progress I've made as a student in a short period of time. During the project, I lost all of my code halfway through due to my own error. This experience taught me the importance of pushing my code to GitHub as frequently as possible.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
This portfolio is meant to showcase applications I've created during the bootcamp. The portfolio section includes links to the applications when the images are clicked. You can also find more information about me and how to get in contact.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
Below are screenshots of the final product:

## Credits

For this project I consulted the following webpages for tutorials:
![w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)

As well as code from my previous applications which can be found here on my ![GitHub.](https://github.com/kris-ramirez) 

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
