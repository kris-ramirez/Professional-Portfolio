# Professional-Portfolio
Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

For this project, my goal was to create a portfolio showcasing my current work. In the future, I plan to add more projects that highlight a range of skills. As I develop new applications, I will include them in this portfolio along with my thought process for each one. I had a portfolio before this one, but I used a service instead of building it myself. By coding this portfolio with the CSS skills I've learned, I can see how much progress I've made as a student in a short period of time. During the project, I lost all of my code halfway through due to my own error. This experience taught me the importance of pushing my code to GitHub as frequently as possible.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
This portfolio is meant to showcase applications I've created during the bootcamp. The portfolio section includes links to the applications when the images are clicked. You can also find more information about me and how to get in contact. 

Follow this link to see the portfolio: https://kris-ramirez.github.io/Professional-Portfolio/

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
Below are screenshots of the final product:
